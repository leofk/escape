## Game Balancing

Throughout the course of our development, we went through many different thought proceses about the best way to develop levels. What started as a platformer, with precise jumps and tight movement timings, expanded in to a game that provides more opportunity to explore and solve puzzles. We still have some challenging levels that require accurate movements, but feedback from players indicated that those levels were on the harder end of the level difficulty and so we knew that we needed to create a well balanced distribution of diffictulies, as well as providing players with the oppotunity to hone their skills and take some levels at a slower pace.  
Throughout the milestones, since M1, we have added and altered our levels based on feedback. Some of that feedback was direct, such as the MTA submissions, while other was obtained by watching over the shoulder of players as they learned the way our game played. It was especially interesting to see the way that players explored, and the kinds of things that they tried while looking for the exit of each level. Watching players test out bumping in to walls to see if they could get through actually caused us to develop puzzle levels that had imaginary walls so that it would reward this kind of game play while also making it tricky to navigate areas that seemed to have left them locked in.

The following is a list we used to ensure that the game provided a balanced amount of levels that were at varrying difficulties.

#### Tutorial

These levels should be easy to complete but force the player to explore/make use of the mechanics in a way that they start to learn when they can/should be used. There should not really be a need to try many times to beat any of these levels. Levels like the introduction of death elements can be trickier since we want the player to learn the bounds of these elements and, in the case of patrol enemies, what their movement is likely to be.  
I can't imagine any of these levels will take longer than 30 seconds to complete.

-   4 tutorial levels to teach gameplay:
    -   Movement/Platforms
    -   Patrol enemies/spikes/collectibles
    -   Lock and Key mechanic
    -   Phasing mechanic

#### Easy

Should make use of the level shift mechanic, enemies, and coins. Encourage players to wander the levels and look all over, don't put too much pressure on them for tight jumps or enemy escapes. It is okay for them to have to make larger jumps and cause deaths but there shouldn't be much need for skill or muscle memory.
These levels might take a minute on first playthrough but should be quicker and more about learning the range of movement and more ways that the mechanics might be used.

-   Level 0 - Lab

-   Level 1 - Cave

-   Level 2 - Forest

-   Level 3 - Lab

-   Level 4 - Cave

-   Level 5 - Forest

#### Medium

Continue to nake use of all of the mechanics, with more emphasis on the phasing mechanic. Place enemies in a way that forces the player to move more rapidly accross platforms or actively dodge them. Tighter jump timings are fine but it shouldn't take more than a couple attempts to be able to perform the jump reliably. More confusing puzzles are encouraged, for example using keys and locks to create vanishing platforms.
These levels should aim take not much more than a minute or two to solve on first playthrough. They should be challenging but still present a player with the ability to feel like they "nailed it" and were able to crack a level quickly, but, by having some technical skill requirements for all levelsm, they will stay fun.

-   Level 6 - Lab

-   Level 7 - Cave

-   Level 8 - Forest

-   Level 9 - Lab

-   Level 10 - Cave

-   Level 11 - Forest

-   Level 12 - Lab

#### Hard

These levels should begin approach somewhat confusing/frustrating but make sure it is not because of poor design (for example hallways that are too small or hitbox abuse). Tight jumps that take several tries to master are a good idea but shouldn't be the entire difficulty of a level because that can create a negative level of frustration. Enemys can be faster moving (use longer flight paths) and should require very short stays on some platforms. Puzzles can require significant exploration and might want to make use of the fact that the spotlight keeps some things hidden to prevent planning/solving.  
It's okay for these levels to take minutes to solve/figure out on first playthrough, the puzzles and technical requirements will inevitably be learnable but still pose a challenge to a player that can't memorize every level.

-   Level 13 - Cave

-   Level 14 - Forest

-   Level 15 - Lab

-   Level 16 - Cave
